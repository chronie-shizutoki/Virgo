                <h4 data-align="left" id="01">01</h4>
                <div class="quote-section">
                  <div class="quote-block">Demeter's daughter darted among the flowers like a light - footed butterfly. She picked gorgeous roses, fragrant violets, snow - white lilies, and crimson hyacinths. She ran and jumped, enjoying herself to the fullest, unaware that her father Zeus had already arranged her fate.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Zeus betrothed her to his brother, Hades, the ruler of the underworld. She had to live with Hades in the dark underground kingdom.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Persephone spends two - thirds of the year with her mother and one - third with her husband, Hades.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">The great Demeter restored fertility to the earth. Everything turned green again and bloomed. Tender green leaves covered the forests once more, and the lush green meadows were ablaze with flowers. Crops quickly sprouted in the fertile fields, the orchards were filled with the fragrance of flowers, and the vineyards sparkled with a green sheen in the sun. The whole of nature came to life. All living beings cheered and praised the great goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">However, Persephone has to bid farewell to her mother every year. Each time, Demeter falls into grief and puts on black clothes again. At this time, the whole of nature mourns Persephone's departure.</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">Persephone is the most well-known mythological archetype of Virgo. This seems to be a story of a "fall of the maiden." Persephone first appears as an innocent daughter/maiden, ignorant of worldly affairs, playing freely in nature, like a butterfly among the flowers. This picture is more like Virgo's pre-existence paradise. When fate arrives, the purest and most innocent maiden becomes the Queen of the Underworld, plummeting from the bright paradise to the dark underworld and entering into marriage with the God of Hell. The sudden turn of fate has no foreshadowing, just like the moment when a chemical reaction takes effect. This is completely different from Leo's hero's journey of trials, which has a long process of growth. Virgo is extreme, with a cliff-like radical change, as if she has two true selves, a convergence of extreme conflicts and opposites, manifested in Persephone's dual life of yin and yang.</p>
                <p data-align="left">The two symbols of Virgo, maiden - Queen of the Underworld, daughter - mother, are used to interpret the meaning of "virgin" from these two polar dimensions. Persephone has never spoken directly. She is silent and invisible. Her mother, Demeter, and her husband, Hades, negotiate her fate and relay (translate) her story. On the one hand, Persephone conveys herself through her mother and husband. "Virgin" does not show itself directly but provides clues and paradoxes about "virgin" in other guises. On the other hand, in the process of being relayed (translated) by her mother and husband, Persephone falls into the cage of her mother and husband. The language of Virgo is like countless Rashomon events, where lies and truth, the virtual and the real, are integrated.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Among the four terms "maiden," "Queen of the Underworld," "daughter," and "mother," the key associated themes are "chastity" and "child." Persephone's existence is first and foremost the intersection of contradictions in the theme of "virgin." "Loss of chastity - childbirth - motherhood" brings life, while "suffering - degradation - marriage alliance" initiates the wheel of fate. The so - called "virgin" or "maiden" is a state of being unformed and unproductive, but it is also an indelible hope.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Persephone's appearance and departure on earth influence the vitality of the earth through her mother's emotions. It can be said that Persephone is in sync with the cycle of nature. This brings out the important mission of Virgo, which is to be the guardian of the natural order. However, since Persephone is not directly connected to the natural order but through her mother, more precisely, Virgo is the guardian channel of the natural order, and she uses others to carry out the work of a guardian.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Combining the stories of Astraia, Aeacus, and Hermeticism, we will find that the "virgin" theme explored by Virgo goes beyond the moral level and human civilization. It is an experience of higher natural laws and cosmic laws. She descends from the realm of chaotic truth to the human world with black and white, up and down in a state of a sleeper and a silent one. It can be said that the mission of Virgo is tragic. She is like the "hope" at the bottom of Pandora's box that has been overlooked, a longing for a leap that should not be "just so." This longing can even be said to be a vain wish, a remembrance of the lost purity that never existed in the Age of Iron.</p>
                <p data-align="left">As the last of the personal constellations, Virgo enters the deepest realm of self - exploration. Different from Libra, the social constellation that takes the lead as a mediator to coordinate relationships, the context of Virgo is an adventurous journey to the highest truth through the individual. From the perspective of the macro - universe and micro - universe, the self is the universe. So the mediation field corresponding to Virgo is the internal natural law sequence of a person, the cosmic truth within the self.</p>
                <p data-align="left">In sharp contrast, Virgo gives the impression of being trivial, stubborn, and nitpicking, which seems far from the above - mentioned highest realm of individual exploration. The popular keywords of Virgo, "cleanliness obsession" and "obsessive - compulsive disorder," contain a kind of stubbornness that is incomprehensible to "outsiders," an excessive attention to detail, which then evolves into a "compulsion," like the pressure from a higher power. This higher power manifested in Persephone is fate, a compulsory force that allows no negotiation or resistance. Even Persephone's own voice, emotions, and expressions are completely drowned out. So, where does this source of pressure come from? In the context of civilization, the so - called "irresistible factors" often refer to non - human factors, such as natural disasters or fate changes. Under these irresistible factors, the individual is insignificant and has little effect. There is a cliff here. It's as if from the moment Persephone was abducted by Hades, she fell into a parallel world, a different kind of world. These two worlds have lost their connection, with different languages and no information transmission. But Persephone is a miracle.</p>
                <p data-align="left">The era we live in, at least in the Chinese context, seems to be an era that advocates the "Virgo spirit" of being hard - working, service - oriented, and submissive. Economic groups love such employees. They won't be trouble - makers but are good at handling problems and ensuring the successful completion of tasks assigned by their superiors. This sounds dull and bitter. Is this really the true "Virgo spirit"?</p>
                <p data-align="left">The virgin is first and foremost proud. She takes pride in her purity without any impurities. The masks of the silent and the invisible are precisely her declarations of pride. However, truth has faded away, or rather, truth has never shown itself in the human world. So no one can declare the standard of truth, which means everyone seems to be able to interpret truth in their own way. This is the chaotic situation in the Age of Iron, but it is also the possible soil for freedom. God only shows himself in the innermost heart of each person, which is even hard to tell others.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Virgo shows tension and anxiety in personality traits. This is Persephone's trauma. In Greek mythology, there are not a few female characters who were abducted and raped, but only Persephone's story takes abduction and loss of chastity as the core elements. Around the abduction, on one side is the resistance from her mother. Here, there is a preconceived idea, whether from her mother Demeter or Persephone herself: marrying Hades, the God of the Underworld, is terrifying. So her mother devoted herself to saving her daughter and had no time to take care of agriculture and the harvest of grains. The desolate scene on earth was in sync with her mother's mood. On the other side is Hades, the King of the Underworld. He seemed more justified and remained unmoved in the underworld. It can be said that Hades' forced marriage to Persephone was tacitly approved by Zeus, so Zeus sent Hermes to persuade the sad Demeter to make peace. Her mother's resistance worked. Although she couldn't bring her daughter back to the earth completely, she at least got back two - thirds of her daughter.</p>
                <p data-align="left">It can be said that Persephone is protected by two sides: her mother and her marriage to death. One is about producing and protecting life, and the other is about eliminating and finally judging life. Both of these forces are so heavy, serious, and imposing that they cannot be underestimated. As a result, Persephone has become the incarnation of both and breathes with them. Persephone is a channel, a messenger, connecting life and death. This unbearable weight of life squeezes Persephone between life and death. If she were not her mother's child, there would be no covenant with death. Virgo is under the gaze of double sources of fear and is a reflection of anxiety. And anxiety is precisely the driving force of the individual universe.</p>
                <h4 data-align="left" id="02">02</h4>
                <div class="quote-section">
                  <div class="quote-block">Zagreus was born to Zeus through Persephone and is the Dionysus of the underworld. </div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Melinoe has two - colored skin, half - black and half - white. These two colors come from Hades' darkness and Zeus' ether. She appears in strange shapes and forms at night, sometimes clearly visible, sometimes hazy, and sometimes flickering in the dark.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Melinoe is a terrifying and punitive goddess, somewhat similar to the Furies. Her appearance at night means an unsettling attack is coming. Melinoe is also involved in the process of souls entering the underworld. She will drive mortals crazy with phantoms in the air. Then, the Queen of the underworld (i.e., Persephone) will banish the souls filled with crazy fear to the deepest part of the earth.</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">Some versions say that Persephone's children are the children of Zeus, while others say they are the children of Hades. Regardless of whether their father is the yang - side Zeus or the yin - side Hades, her children have indeed pushed the dark side to the extreme.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Her son, Zagreus, is the God of Wine in the underworld; her daughter, Melinoe, has two - colored skin and is the Goddess of Fear and Vengeance. They are both active in the underworld, existing as children hidden underground and releasing madness, fear, and anger there. A sad mother, a dark husband, and furious children. Persephone's nightmare has shown no signs of subsiding since the "deprivation of virginity" but has further evolved. The vitality of "pain" is so endless. Persephone is like a static face, frozen at the moment of being raped. People release violence, sadness, fear, and anger on this face, and "virgin" is the unshakable background. In this way, Persephone's silent, still, and huge face is actually the vast universe itself, maintaining a static balance and order, an image of God.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Or rather, Persephone represents the eternal and inevitable trauma in human fate. As Lu Xun said, tragedy is to tear apart beautiful things in front of people. This is different from Medea's fury and revenge. The themes of anger, madness, and revenge played out by Persephone are more of a helplessness, a cosmic law beyond individual actions. She is not about personal revenge but is like a law - enforcement field in purgatory. Persephone is a metaphor for the times and a metaphor for the trauma of human fate. She is a huge war machine painted with a human face. Compared to Helen being regarded as the fuse of the Trojan War, Persephone is more of an eyewitness to the cruelty of the cosmic rhythm on the eternal battlefield of life.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Although Persephone is the spokesperson of "virgin," compared to the three virgin goddesses Athena, Hestia, and Artemis, Persephone not only has a marriage but also children. Throughout, Persephone has never declared that she wants to choose to be a "virgin." She is more like a "lost virgin." She has a sad mother, a dark husband, and furious children. In this family sequence, "virgin" seems to be a dead obsession that doesn't exist. Corresponding to Astraia's story, Persephone's virgin soul is the Golden Age in Astraia's heart.</p>

                <p data-align="left">Early goddess of justice, purity, and virginity, wearing chains and holding an olive branch</p>
                <h3 data-align="left" id="Interpretation">Interpretation</h3>
                <h4 data-align="left" id="01">01</h4>
                <div class="quote-section">
                  <div class="quote-block">The early days of human existence were called the "Golden Age." At that time, the climate was getting warmer. People didn't need housing or clothes, and they could still have harvests without farming. The earth was a peaceful paradise, and people didn't know what quarrels were. The gods lived in harmony with humans on the earth.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">However, later there were the four seasons of cold and heat. People had to build houses, weave clothes, and cultivate fields. At the same time, the phenomenon of the strong bullying the weak also appeared around them. The gods were disgusted with human conflicts and left the mortal world for the sky. Only Astraia believed in humans and remained on the earth, enthusiastically teaching the way of justice. This was the "Silver Age."</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">Rather than saying that Astraia believed in humans, it is more accurate to say that she believed that the cosmic rhythm was not degenerate. The survival struggles among humans due to the passage of time are also part of the cosmic rhythm. The "justice" that Astraia wanted to teach was to determine who was wrong and who was not, so as to restore the truth and show it to everyone. Therefore, rather than saying that Astraia was a protector of the degenerate humans, it is more appropriate to say that she was a defender of cosmic truth.</p>
                <h4 data-align="left" id="02">02</h4>
                <div class="quote-section">
                  <div class="quote-block">In the "Bronze Age," humans began to lie and use violence. There were also bloody battles among relatives, fathers and sons, and brothers. Astraia alone was unable to control the spread of evil. In desperation, she had to wrap her pure body in white gauze and leave the mortal world to return to Mount Olympus. Her departure symbolized the end of absolute purity and justice on earth. On the way, Astraia met Poseidon, the God of the Sea. Poseidon mocked her for sympathizing with the savage and cruel humans. Astraia argued with him, and they even had a quarrel. They went to Zeus, the God of the Sky, to ask for a fair judgment. Astraia transformed her body into a huge olive tree, with golden olives hanging among the green leaves. All the gods present felt peace, tolerance, and kindness. So the gods unanimously judged that Astraia won.</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">Obviously, Astraia is not the recognized spokesperson of truth. Even her credibility as a judge is not as high as that of the gods of Libra. Astraia is isolated and, from a certain perspective, even weak. She chose her own cause, so no one knew her mission earlier than she did. Astraia, who took justice most seriously, was unable to convince others and even had to ask Zeus to make a judgment. This is very thought - provoking. Astraia is like an opposition party. She even disdains to participate in power and turn her personal cause into a public one. But paradoxically, the personal cause she chose does involve everyone, so she eventually had to participate in public affairs. Through self - proof, she made more people receive her transmission of the profound meaning of truth.</p>
                <p data-align="left">The Bronze Age is also a symbol of the era of war. War and heroic epics are also part of the rhythm.</p>
                <h4 data-align="left" id="03">03</h4>
                <div class="quote-section">
                  <div class="quote-block">The fifth era in which the last generation of humans lived is the Age of Iron. This era has continued on earth until now. People are constantly suffering from sorrow and heavy labor day and night. The gods bring painful troubles to people. The children of this generation are disrespectful to their parents, friends are not loyal to each other, hosts are not hospitable, and brothers do not love each other. This generation does not abide by their oaths and does not advocate justice and kindness. They destroy each other's cities and are full of violence everywhere. People only value honor and strength. The goddesses of conscience and justice have bid farewell to people. They flew back to the lofty Mount Olympus in white robes and returned to the immortal gods, leaving only deep disasters for humans, which people have no ability to resist.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Since Prometheus stole the divine fire and gave it to mortals, teaching them various skills and crafts and imparting various knowledge to them, the lives of people on earth have become relatively happier. These actions of Prometheus angered Zeus. He severely punished Prometheus and at the same time brought disasters to the humans on earth.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Curious Pandora secretly opened the lid of the box. As a result, the disasters that had been locked in the box flew out, so that disasters were everywhere on earth. Only "Hope" remained at the bottom of this big box. The lid of the box snapped shut, and "Hope" failed to fly out of Epimetheus' house.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Astraia was extremely anxious when she saw this scene because she believed that humans had not lost their conscience and many people were innocent. So she begged the gods to forgive humans and was willing to bear the punishment on their behalf. She was willing to wear chains, be punished for humans, and kneel on the cliff of Mount Olympus for years, praying for the arrival of hope for humans.</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">Astraia's myth is an important clue to explore the profound and grand themes of Virgo. Astraia came from the distant Golden Age but has been active until the Age of Iron. Astraia can be regarded as a real elder, a pioneer exile. Virgo is profound. She is the most representative symbol of the laws of the macro - universe and micro - universe. She is like a meteorite that has survived from the vast expanse and has now become the necessary tableware for people's lives.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Astraia wearing chains and being punished for humans gives me more inspiration about the religious connotations of Christ's suffering and Joan of Arc. I used to think that such acts of suffering were both stupid and arrogant, even evil. Human original sin has not been eliminated because they bore the punishment for others. Instead, an additional layer of sin has been added. People accept Christ's suffering without knowing or passively. Once aware of this double sin, people cannot feel justified about their own "happiness" and realize the hypocrisy of their happiness, so they have to bear double the pain. But if we temporarily put aside the boundaries between self and others and integrate them into one, when we perceive Astraia, we become Astraia, including her purity and the pain she endured. At the same time, we enter a more grand sequence of the cosmic rhythm.</p>
                <p data-align="left">It is not surprising that Virgo is often regarded as a "weirdo" because she is indeed an alien. She came from the Golden Age and has the potential for a firm stance and the mission of being a "divine messenger." "Virgo is not here to serve others but to follow the principle of service."</p>

                <div class="quote-section">
                  <div class="quote-block">Aeacus loved truth and upheld justice. The Olympian gods often asked him to be the judge of their disputes. After his death, like Minos and Rhadamanthys, according to the will of the gods, he became a judge in the underworld.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Only the goddess Hera hated Aeacus. Hera brought a great disaster to Aeacus' kingdom. After the poisonous fog, countless snakes crawled out of the ponds, springs, and streams on the island of Aegina. They poisoned everything. A terrible large - scale plague broke out on the island, and all living beings died out, except for Aeacus and his son. In despair, Aeacus stretched out his hands to the sky and shouted loudly, "Oh, great Zeus, if you are really Aegina's husband, if you are really my father, and if you don't want to be ashamed of your descendants, then either give me back my people or send me quickly to the dark grave!"</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Aeacus had a strange dream. He dreamed that countless ants were crawling on Zeus' sacred oak tree. When the oak tree shook, the ants on the branches fell like a dense rain. After the ants fell to the ground, they grew bigger and bigger. Finally, they stood up on their two hind legs, straightened their bodies, shed their black color, changed their shapes, and gradually turned into humans.</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">The ant - people are a wonderful symbol. Aeacus was pushed to the brink by Hera and became the only survivor on the island of death. The words "Give me back my people or send me to the grave" revealed the two paths of Virgo: either stay on earth to form an ant army and rebuild a "beautiful" homeland; or enter the underworld, face fear and darkness, and become a judge of death, a judge in the underworld.</p>
                <p data-align="left">Ants, here, form the symbol of Virgo. Their symbolic meaning is very rich: weak, hard - working, accumulating little by little, and also carrying fear, being secretive, and hard to notice, just like Jung's collective unconscious that is infinitely large and infinitely small. The characteristics of Virgo that span time and carry the ancient cosmic rhythm are extended through the more specific themes of ants and hell, the microcosmic and death.</p>

After its release, his divinity allowed him to see the mysteries of the surreal space.</div>

                <div class="quote-section">
                  <div class="quote-block">Hermes rose into the divine light, and the material world gradually faded from his consciousness. Now a darkness descended and kept expanding, devouring the light. Everything was chaos.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Then a mysterious and sacred word appeared in the devoured light, floating on the smoky water. This word was called the divine word of reason.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Reason should separate light from darkness and establish truth in the water.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">Those who ascend along the path of the word can become gods, while those who cannot ascend remain mortals.</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">This is the first stage in Jung's alchemical process, the nigredo period. Reason separates light from darkness, gods from mortals, melts the hard - fixed matter in the water, creates new life, ascends, and enters the albedo period.</p>

                  <div class="quote-block">The universe you see was first cast in a mold before its formation. This mold is called the archetype, which already existed in God's mind long before creation.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">God used the word of reason as a hammer to make holes in the original space, cast different spatial forms into the archetype mold, and at the same time sewed the seeds of life into the created bodies to form an ordered universe with various elements in their respective layers.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">This word hovered between light and darkness and was passed on to another mind, called the Artisan, the Builder, or the Creator.</div>
                </div>
                <p data-align="left">The process of analysis is to look back at the formation of the self - that is, the archetype, the primitive, uncivilized, archetypal self - the mold. Then use the word of reason as a hammer, constantly strike and rub to generate fire. The work of Virgo is often regarded as trivial, boring, insignificant, and full of compulsive tendencies. But as a transmitter of the mind and a builder, the process of construction is essential. And the so - called construction work - that is, the choice of how to spend every moment in daily life.</p>

                  <div class="quote-block">Man on earth is a combination. Inside, he is a celestial being, a god, and beautiful; on the outside, he is nature, a mortal, and fragile. Therefore, the root of pain is that the celestial being falls in love with his own shadow, abandons reality, and indulges in dark illusions. As a god, man possesses the energy of the seven rulers, as well as life, light, and the word. But as a mortal, he is controlled by the ring of the rulers, that is, fate.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">The god is hermaphroditic and always awake, never sleeping.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">The combined man has an immortal soul and a mortal body.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">God makes those with a mind know that they are gods, know that death is caused by loving their own bodies, and make them know all existing things. Because only by knowing oneself can one enter the perfect world.</div>
                  <div class="quote-block">For the ignorant, the body is supreme. They cannot recognize their own shadow in their hearts and indulge in dark illusions.</div>
